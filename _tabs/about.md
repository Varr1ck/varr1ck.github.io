**Hello my dear readers!**

I know what you may think there in your little nerdy minds...  
You have already guessed it, haven't ya?

Let's make it quick - the name is referring to (imagine an announcer at WWE) the one and only, the glorious one, the never be forgotten MVP of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - here he is, the Roooom of Requiremeeeents. 

After we got this done let's just focus for one second - yeah yeah I know you're busy - I'll make it quick for ya folks 'kay?  
This website is really meant as a space to be filled with all sort of helpful and interesting stuff; room by room. Places where like-minded people can help each other and discuss. 

**I would be thankful to everyone of you out there if we could be polite to each other and give toxicity no way into this cozy rooms of little adventures :)**  

With that being said.

**Quick. Get in my dear friend. The night is cold and full of terrors.**
